EC2: stands for Elastic Cloud Compute 
You can understand EC2 is a virtual machine run on cloud.
We have some concepts:
	EBS: where you can save your data.
	ELB: using for distributing load balancing
	ASG: auto scaling group.
	AMI: Amazon machine image
SSH into an ec2 instance, you need to have a keypair that is pem file. You can ssh with linux, Mac and Win10, with old window version you must using putty.
command to ssh into EC2: ssh -i keypair.pem ec2@pulic-id
Security Groups:
	will have a role same as firewall to control how traffic will be allowed into your ec2 machines.
	- inbound: tpc - port 22
	- outbound: default allow all access
