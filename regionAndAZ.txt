- AWS is a global cloud provider.
There are many data centers all arround the world so there are called REGION.
Therefore it has many regions.
Inshort, region is a set of data centers.
Region has a naming convention.
eg: eu-west-1, eu-west-2
Region is a cluster of data centers.
If you use AWS Service in a region, you won't see your data in another region.
- AZ (Availability zone)
Each region can have many AZ, usually it's going to be three AZ per region, maybe 2 or 6, 
using abcdef letters.
eg: eu-west-1a, eu-west-1b
Each AZ is one or more discrete data centers.
All AZ in a region are seperate -> isolated from disasters but they are connected by high bandwidth with ultra-low latency.
